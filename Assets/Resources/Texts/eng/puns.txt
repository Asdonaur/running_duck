Game Over!
Ha ha, you lost!
You lost again!
HA!
...
Go away!
Don't you have any responsabilities?
Do something else!
Go get a job!
Do your homework!
Maybe you should get a bath, because you suck!
Are you having fun?
Why don't you stop playing this and try Asdonaur's other games?
You could unplug your WIFI connection and play the original...
What are you expecting to happen?
Come on, the duck is getting tired of running!
Seriously, I'm starting to get bored...
Are you losing in prupose so you can see all my quotes?
Apparently, you love getting insulted by me...
Is pressing a button that hard?
Your family should be worried.
Go talk with your friends... In case you have.
Maybe you should take a rest.
This quote indicates that you have failed in your task of avoiding that object because you probably pressed the button too late or too soon.
This is animal abuse!
You have great skills at losing miserably!
Sorry, I was in the bathroom and I could not watch your fail.
Nice failure!
I'm running out of insults!
Are you playing with your feet?
I could say "Try again", but maybe you should just give up.
You have a lot of free time...
Do something useful!
Other! Other! Other!
Repeat it! Repeat it!
You're still here? How addicted...
I know 3 ridiculous people, and you are 4 of them.
Asdonaur would be dissapointed.
Congratulations! You lost!
You lost again?
You suck, my dear friend!
If you are going to waste your time here, at least do it better...
Maybe you should go outside and take some fresh air...
HINT: You can jump in order to avoid trees.
Did you know that you should avoid that?
This failure will remain on your conscience.
Good, now let your older sibling play!
Maybe you can do it better if you play in the bathroom...
Try plugging your keyboard.
QUACK QUACK QUACK
That obstacle is not as big as it seems.
"Fracasando Ando", right?
Did you fall again?
You're not a clown, you're the entire circus.
I'm not mad, I'm just dissapointed.
A Loser Is You
Not bad... FOR A CRIMINAL
Mission Failed
Fission Mailed
Not again! You should know better...
