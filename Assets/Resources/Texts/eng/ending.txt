Well, good job! You broke the game!
Are you felling proud of your achievement?
Now you can't even play again!
Use ALT + F4 and never return!
.....
You are still here...
Why? Why are you so addicted to this game?
What does this game have that the others don't?
This game is not even finished!
That's why I tried to make you rage!
I wanted you to go away before you broke it!
...
But to be honest, I appreciate your company.
I had fun screaming to you...
You're a stubborn, and I appreciate it.
Umm, what else can I say?
I hope you had as much fun as me with this thing, even though it's broken now...
And most importantly, thanks for playing with me! :D
